# WorldRebuild

Trying to resurrect the WorldRebuild plugin for Bukkit.

Apparently, it's GPLv3

I have downloaded the .jar file, and decompiled it.

## TODO

- [x] Create `pom.xml`.
- [ ] Refactor a little, to acquaint myself with the code.
- [x] Update according to new APIs.
- [ ] Make sure it works.
- [ ] Attempt to contact the original author tobynextdoor, to present my findings.
