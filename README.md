# WorldRebuild

Trying to resurrect the WorldRebuild plugin for Bukkit.

Apparently, it's GPLv3 licensed: [https://web.archive.org/web/20200808063349/https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldrebuild](https://web.archive.org/web/20200808063349/https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldrebuild)

I have downloaded the .jar file, and decompiled it.

## TODO

- [ ] Create `pom.xml`.
- [ ] Refactor a little, to aquaint myself with the code.
- [ ] Update according to new APIs.
- [ ] Make sure it works.
- [ ] Attempt to get ahold of original author tobynextdoor to present my findings.
